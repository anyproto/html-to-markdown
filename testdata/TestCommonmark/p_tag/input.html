    Sometimes a struct field, function, type, or even a whole package becomes


    redundant or unnecessary, but must be kept for compatibility with existing

    To signal that an identifier should not be used, add a paragraph to its doc


    comment that begins with "Deprecated:" followed by some information about the


    deprecation.


    There are a few examples <a href="https://golang.org/search?q=Deprecated:" target="_blank">in the standard library</a>.
